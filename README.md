# Slice and Splice Algorithm

This is my solution to the Slice and Splice Algorithm challenge from freeCodeCamp.

## User Stories

>> Create a frankenSplice function that accepts two arrays and an index.
Copy each element of the first array into the second array, in order, beginning at the given index, and return the resulting array.
The input arrays should remain the same after the function runs.
>> 
### Example:

```js
frankenSplice([1, 2], ["a", "b"], 1) should return ["a", 1, 2, "b"].
